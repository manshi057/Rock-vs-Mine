# Rock-vs-Mine
ðŸš¢ Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction
This is a machine learning model that predicts whether a given set of data is of sonar readings correspond to a Rock or Mine using a Logistic Regression model
and follows supervised learning model.

Sonar vs Rock Prediction Model

Overview:-

This project is a machine learning-based classification model designed to differentiate between sonar signals reflected from rocks and mines. It utilizes Python and various ML techniques to achieve high accuracy in prediction.

Dataset

The model is trained using the Sonar Dataset, which consists of 208 samples, each containing 60 numerical features representing sonar wave frequencies. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

Technologies Used:-

1)Python

2)Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)

3)Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)

4)Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Installation:-

To run this project on your local machine, ensure you have Python installed and set up the required dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Model Training & Evaluation

Load the dataset and preprocess it.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.

Usage:-

Run the Python script to train and test the model:

python sonar_vs_rock.py

After execution, the model will output the classification results along with performance metrics.

Results:-

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately X% (replace with actual accuracy after evaluation), making it effective for classifying sonar signals.

Future Improvements:-

Implement deep learning models for better accuracy.

Perform feature selection for optimized model performance.

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
